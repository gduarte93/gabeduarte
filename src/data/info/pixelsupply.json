They are certified Shopify experts, who specialize in setting up online stores for businesses.<br/><br/>Being a small company, with a start-up mentality, I was allowed to see and touch many aspects of the business. I was there when clients walked in to discuss their vision for the site. I saw that vision gradually turn into page mockups. And then, in what became my main role, I turned those mocks into fully functioning and responsive websites using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Liquid.",
