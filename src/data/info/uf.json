The app, Dressolutions, allows users to submit pictures of clothes for other members to rate.<br/><br/>The temporariness comes from other users only being able to see the outfit for 10 seconds before giving their rating. Because people donâ€™t have a long time to stare at an outfit to make up their minds, the rating is a good quantifier for the initial impression it makes.<br/><br/>We used a PostgreSQL relational database to store user and clothes data. Users were able to have friends, which we were able to pull through database queries. Other things we queried the database for were top users, top stores, cheapest stores, top outfits, most recent outfits, as well as search.<br/><br/>We used PHP for the back end, and HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the front end.<br/><br/>My responsibilities for this project were designing and coding the front end. This includes the home page, register modal, header, dropdown, and dress cards. As well as the client side functionality such as bringing up a modal on card click."
